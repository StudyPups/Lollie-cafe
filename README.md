# 🌸 Loli's Cafe Game 🌸

## What is this?

This is a game I made with my mum! You run a cafe and have to give customers the right food and drinks.

## How to play

1. Click "Start Game"
2. Read what the customer wants
3. Click the right treat to give them
4. Try to get as many orders right as you can!

## What I learned

I learned how to code! I made this using:
- **HTML** - to put the information on to the web page
- **CSS** - to make it look pretty
- **JavaScript** - to make the buttons work

## Try it out!
